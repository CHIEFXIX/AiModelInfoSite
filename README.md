Additionally, users have the opportunity to contribute to the community by adding their own AI models to the repository, fostering collaboration and knowledge sharing among peers.

Whether you're seeking inspiration for your next project, conducting research, or simply staying updated on the latest advancements in AI technology, the AI Model App serves as your go-to resource. Explore, learn, and contribute to the ever-expanding world of artificial intelligence with ease and convenience.

## JavaScript Framework
The project is built using React as the primary JavaScript framework. No major plugins or packages were installed beyond React itself.

## Installation
To install and run the AI Model App locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

    ```
    git clone <repository-url>
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```
    cd ai-model-app
    ```

3. Install dependencies:

    ```
    npm install
    ```

4. Start the development server:

    ```
    npm start
    ```

5. Open your web browser and visit `http://localhost:3000` to view the app.

## Page Load Time
The page load time of the application was measured using browser developer tools, particularly the Network tab which provides insights into the loading times of various resources. Additionally, performance monitoring tools like Lighthouse or Google PageSpeed Insights can also be used for more comprehensive analysis.

## Optimizations

### WebP Optimization
To optimize image loading times, the AI Model App utilizes the WebP image format. WebP offers better compression and quality compared to traditional formats like JPEG or PNG, resulting in faster load times for images. This Optimization increased performance from 84% to 91%.

### CSS and JS Optimization
CSS and JavaScript files are minified and compressed to reduce their file sizes. Minification removes unnecessary characters and spaces from code, while compression further reduces file sizes for faster download times. This optimization enhances the overall performance of the application by improving load times for CSS and JavaScript resources. This Optimization increased Best Practices from 91% to 96%.

## Performance Monitoring
Tools like Chrome DevTools, Lighthouse and Google PageInsights were used to monitor various performance metrics such as page load times, rendering times, and resource utilization. By analyzing these metrics, developers can optimize the app's performance and ensure a smooth user experience.

By implementing these optimizations, the AI Model App aims to provide users with a faster and more responsive browsing experience while accessing and contributing to AI model data.
